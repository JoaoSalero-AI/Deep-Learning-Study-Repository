# Artifitial Neural Network 

In this challenge I developed a Neural Network from scratch, without using framework! 

## The Steps:

- 1st Step - Dev an Artificial Neural Network with only math operations - no Frameworks.
- 2nd Step - Training to predict occurrence of cancer.

## The Archtecture of Artifitial Neural Network
A typical neural network consists of a set of interconnected neurons, influencing each other to form a larger system, capable of storing knowledge acquired through the examples presented and, thus, being able to make inferences on new sets of data. Let's look at the architecture of artificial neural networks.

Neural networks are commonly presented as a directed graph, where the vertices are neurons and the edges are synapses. The direction of the edges informs the type of feeding, that is, how the neurons are fed (receive input signals). Neural networks derive their power from their massive, parallel structure and ability to learn from experience. This experience is transmitted through examples obtained from the real world, defined as a set of characteristics formed by input and output data. If we present these input and output data to the network, we are faced with supervised learning and if we present only the input data, we are faced with unsupervised learning!

The knowledge obtained by the network through the examples is stored in the form of connection weights, which will be adjusted in order to make correct decisions based on new inputs, that is, new real-world situations not known by the network. The synaptic weight adjustment process is performed by the learning algorithm, responsible for storing in the network the real-world knowledge obtained through examples. There are several learning algorithms, among them the backpropagation which is the most used algorithm.

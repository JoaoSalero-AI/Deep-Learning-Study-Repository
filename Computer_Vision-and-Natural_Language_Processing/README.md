# <font color='blue'>Computer Vision and Natural Language Processing for Automatic Subtitle Generation</font>

## Defining the Project

Project of Computer Vision for image recognation. As a plus have one another Deep Learning model to generate subtitle for each image automatically.  <br>

In both cases we will create models with very deep architectures and we will need to use the GPU to train the models. Once trained, we will use the application to generate captions on new images.
